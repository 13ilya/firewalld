.SH NAME
firewalld.service \- firewalld service configuration files

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fI@SYSCONFDIR@/firewalld/services/<service>.xml\fR
\fI@PREFIX@/lib/firewalld/services/<service>.xml\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
A \fIfirewalld.service\fR configuration file contains the information for a service.

This example configuration file shows the structure of a service configuration file:

.nf
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<service version="\fI1.0\fR">
  <short>\fIMy Service\fR</short>
  <description>\fIdescription\fR</description>
  <port port="\fI137\fR" protocol="\fItcp\fR"/>
  <module name="\fInf_conntrack_netbios_ns\fR"/>
  <destination ipv4="\fI224.0.0.251\fR" ipv6="\fIff02::fb\fR"/>
</service>
.fi

.SH OPTIONS
The config can contain these tags and attributes. Some of them are mandatory, others optional.

.SS service
The mandatory service start and end tag defines the service. This tag can only be used once in a service configuration file. There are optional attributes for services:

\fIversion="\fR<string>\fI"\fR
.RS 4
To give the service a version.
.RE

.SS short
Is an optional start and end tag and is used to give a service a more readable name.

.SS description
Is an optional start and end tag to have a description for a service.

.SS port
Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several times to have more than one port entry. All attributes of a port entry are mandatory:

\fIport="\fR<string>\fI"\fR
.RS 4
The port or port range string to be enabled. The value is of the form \fI<port>[-<port>]\fR, where port is a port id.
.RE

\fIprotocol="\fR<string>\fI"\fR
.RS 4
The protocol value can either be \fI"tcp"\fR or \fI"udp"\fR.
.RE

.SS module
Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used several times to enable more than one netfilter kernel helper for the service. A module entry has exactly one attribute:

\fIname="\fR<string>\fI"\fR
.RS 4
defines the name of the kernel netfilter helper as a string.
.RE

.SS destination
Is an optional empty-element tag and can be used only once. The destination specifies the destination network as a network IP address (optional with /mask), or a plain IP address. It is also possible to use hostnames, these will only be resolved at service activation and transmitted to the kernel. The use of hostnames is not recommended. For more information in this element, please have a look at \fIiptables\fR(8) and \fIip6tables\fR(8).

This entry has two attributes, at least one of them needs to be specified. If only one of them is specified, the service will only be added to this destination.

\fIipv4="\fR<string>\fI"\fR
.RS 4
The IPv4 destination address.
.RE

\fIipv6="\fR<string>\fI"\fR
.RS 4
The IPv6 destination address.
.RE

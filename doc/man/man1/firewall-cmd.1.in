.SH NAME
firewall-cmd \- firewalld command line client


.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBfirewall-cmd\fR\ \fB[OPTIONS..]\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfirewall-cmd\fR is the command line client of the firewalld daemon. It provides interface to manage runtime and permanent configuration.

.SH OPTIONS

The following options are supported:

.SS Help Options
.TP
\fB-h\fR, \fB--help\fR
Print a description of the options of firewall-cmd.
.TP
\fB-V\fR, \fB--version\fR
Print the version string of firewalld.

.SS Status Options
.TP
\fB--state\fR
Check whether the firewalld daemon is active (i.e. running). Returns an exit code 0 if it is active, \fINOT_RUNNING\fR (see \fIEXIT CODES\fR) otherwise. This will also print the state to STDOUT.
.TP
\fB--reload\fR
Reload firewall rules and keep state information.
.TP
\fB--complete-reload\fR
Reload firewall completely, even netfilter kernel modules. This will most likely terminate active connections, because state information is lost. This option should only be used in case of severe firewall problems. For example if there are state information problems that no connection can be established with correct firewall rules.

.SS Panic Options
.TP
\fB--panic-on\fR
Enable panic mode. All incoming and outgoing packets are dropped, active connections will expire. Enable this only if there are serious problems with your network environment. For example if the machine is getting hacked in.
.TP
\fB--panic-off\fR
Disable panic mode again. After disabling panic mode established connections might work again, if panic mode was enabled for a short period of time.
.TP
\fB--query-panic\fR
Returns 0 if panic mode is enabled, 1 otherwise.

.SS Lockdown Options
Local applications or services are able to change the firewall configuration if they are running as root (example: libvirt) or are authenticated using PolicyKit. With this feature the administator can lock the firewall configuration so that only applications that are in the lockdown whitelist are able to request firewall changes.

The lockdown access check limits D-Bus methods that are changing firewall rules. Query, list and get methods are not limited.

The lockdown feature is a very light version of user and application policies for firewalld and is turned off by default.

.TP
\fB--lockdown-on\fR
Enable lockdown.
.TP
\fB--lockdown-off\fR
Disable lockdown.
.TP
\fB--query-lockdown\fR
Query if lockdown is enabled. Returns 0 if lockdown is enabled, 1 otherwise.

.SS Lockdown Whitelist Options
The lockdown whitelist can contain \fIcommands\fR, \fIcontexts\fR, \fIusers\fR and \fIuser ids\fR.

If a command entry in the whitelit ends with an asterisk '*', then all command lines starting with the command will match. If the '*' is not there the absolute command inclusive arguments must match.

Commands for user root and others is not always the same. Example: As root /bin/firewall-cmd is used, as a normal user /usr/bin/firewall-cmd is be used on Fedora. 

The context is the cntext of a running application or service. To get the context of a running application use

ps -e --context 

Warning: If the context is unconfined, then this will open access for more than the desired application.

.SS Rich Language

With the rich language more complex firewall rules can be created in an easy to understand way. The language will use keywords with values and will be an abstract representation of ip*tables rules. Zones can be configured using this language, the current configuration will still be supported. 

The rich language extends the current zone elements (service, port, icmp-block, masquerade and forward-port) with additional source and destination addresses, logging, actions and limits for logs and actions. 

rule [family="<rule family>"]
  [ source address="<address>" [invert="True"] ]
  [ destination address="<address>" [invert="True"] ]
  [ <element> ]
  [ log [prefix="<prefix text>"] [level="<log level>"] ]
  [ audit type="<audit type>" ]
  <action>

A rule is part of a zone. A zone can contain several rules. If some rules interact/contradict, the first rule that matches the packet "wins". If the rule family is provided, it can be either "ipv4" or "ipv6", which limits the rule to IPv4 or IPv6. If the rule family is not provided, the rule will be added for IPv4 and IPv6. If source or destination addresses are used in a rule, then the rule family need to be provided. This is also the case for port/packet forwarding.

\fBSource\fR

With the source address the origin of a connection attempt can be limited to the source address. A source address or address range is either an IP address or a network IP address with a mask for IPv4 or IPv6. The network family (IPv4/IPv6) will be automatically discovered. For IPv4, the mask can be a network mask or a plain number. For IPv6 the mask is a plain number. The use of host names is not supported. It is possible to invert the sense of an address by adding \fBinvert\fR=\fI"true"\fR or \fBinvert\fR=\fI"yes"\fR. All but the used address with match.

\fBDestination\fR

With the destination address the target can be limited to the destination address. The destination address is using the same syntax as the source address.

The use of source and destination addresses is optional and the use of a destination addresses is not possible with all elements. This depends on the use of destination addresses for example in service entries.

The element can be exactly one of the element types \fIservice\fR, \fIport\fR, \fIprotocol\fR, \fImasquerade\fR, \fIicmp-block\fR and \fIforward-port\fR. 

\fBService\fR

service name="<service name>"

The service <service name> will be added to the rule. The service name is one of the firewalld provided services. To get a list of the supported services, use firewall-cmd \fI--get-services\fR.

If a service provides a destination address, it will conflict with a destination address in the rule and will result in an error. The services using destination addresses internally are mostly services using multicast.

\fBPort\fR

port port="<port value>" protocol="tcp|udp"

The port <value> can either be a single port number or a port range <id>-<id>. The protocol can either be \fI"tcp"\fR or \fI"udp"\fR.

\fBProtocol\fR

protocol value="<protocol value>"

The protocol value can be either a protocol id number or a protocol name. For allowed protocol entries, please have a look at \fI/etc/protocols\fR.

\fBICMP-Block\fR

icmp-block name="<icmtype name>"

The icmptype is the one of the icmp types firewalld supports. To get a listing of supported icmp types: firewall-cmd --get-icmptypes

It is not allowed to specify an action here. icmp-block uses the action reject internally.

\fBMasquerade\fR

masquerade

Turn on masquerading in the rule. A source address can be provided to limit masquerading to this area, but not a destination address.

It is not allowed to specify an action here.

\fBForward-Port\fR

forward-port port="<port value>" protocol="tcp|udp" to-port="<port value>" to-address="<address>"

Forward port/packets from local port <value> with protocol "tcp" or "udp" to either another port locally or to another machine or to another port on another machine.

The port <value> can either be a single port number or a port range <id>-<id>. The destination address is a simple ip address.

It is not allowed to specify an action here. forward-port uses the action accept internally.

\fBLog\fR

Log new connection attempts to the rule with kernel logging for example in syslog. You can define a prefix text that will be added to the log message as a prefix. Log level can be one of "emerg", "alert", "crit", "err", "warn", "notice", "info" or "debug". The use of log is optional.

It is possible to limit logging:

log [prefix="<prefix text>"] [level="<log level>"] limit value="<rate/duration>"

The rate is a natural positive number [1, ..], the duration of of "s", "m", "h", "d". "s" means seconds, "m" minutes, "h" hours and "d" days. The maximum limit value is "1/d" which means at maximum one log entry per day.

\fBAudit\fR

Audit provides an alternative way for logging using audit records sent to the service auditd. The audit type can be one of "ACCEPT", "REJECT" or "DROP". The use of audit is optional.

Also audit can be limited using the limit tag.

\fBActions\fR

An action can be one of \fIaccept\fR, \fIreject\fR or \fIdrop\fR.

The rule can either contain an element or also a source only. If the rule contains an element, then new connection matching the element will be handled with the action. If the rule does not contain an element, then everything from the source address will be handled with the action (requires firewalld version 0.3.1).

accept | reject [type="<reject type>"] | drop

With accept all new connection attempts will be granted. With reject they will not be accepted and there source will get a reject message. The reject type can be set to use an other value. With drop all packets will be dropped immediately, there is no information sent to the source.

\fBInformation about logging and actions\fR

Logging can be done with the LOG and also with audit. A new chain is added to all zones: <zone>_log. This will be jumped into before the deny chain to be able to have a proper ordering.

The rules or parts of them are placed in separate chains according to the action of the rule:

 <zone>_log
 <zone>_deny
 <zone>_allow

Then all logging rules will be placed in the <zone>_log chain, which will be walked first. All reject and drop rules will be placed in the <zone>_deny chain, which will be walked after the log chain. All accept rules will be placed in the <zone>_allow chain, which will be walked after the deny chain. If a rule contains log and also deny or allow actions, the parts are placed in the matching chains.

\fBExample 1:\fR Enable new IPv4 and IPv6 connections for protocol \fI'ah'\fR

rule protocol value="ah" accept

\fBExample 2:\fR Allow new IPv4 and IPv6 connections for service ftp and log 1 per minute using audit

rule service name="ftp" audit type="ACCEPT" limit value="1/m" audit accept

\fBExample 3:\fR Allow new IPv4 connections from address 192.168.0.0/24 for service tftp and log 1 per minutes using syslog

rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.0.0/24" service name="tftp" log prefix="tftp" level="info" limit value="1/m" accept

\fBExample 4:\fR New IPv6 connections from 1:2:3:4:6:: to service radius are all rejected and logged at a rate of 3 per minute. New IPv6 connections from other sources are accepted.

rule family="ipv6" source address="1:2:3:4:6::" service name="radius" log prefix="dns" level="info" limit value="3/m" reject
rule family="ipv6" service name="radius" accept

\fBExample 5:\fR Forward IPv6 port/packets receiving from 1:2:3:4:6:: on port 4011 with protocol tcp to 1::2:3:4:7 on port 4012

rule family="ipv6" source address="1:2:3:4:6::" forward-port to-addr="1::2:3:4:7" to-port="4012" protocol="tcp" port="4011"

\fBExample 6:\fR White-list source address to allow all connections from this source

rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.2.2" accept

\fBExample 7:\fR Black-list source address to reject all connections from this source

rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.2.3" reject

\fBExample 8:\fR Black-list source address to drop all connections from this source

rule family="ipv4" source address="192.168.2.4" drop

Add a rule with the arguments \fI<args>\fR to chain \fI<chain>\fR in table \fI<table>\fR with priority \fI<priority>\fR.
The \fI<priority>\fR is used to order rules. Priority 0 means add rule on top of the chain, with a higher priority the rule will be added further down. Rules with the same priority are on the same level and the order of these rules is not fixed and may change. If you want to make sure that a rule will be added after another one, use a low priority for the first and a higher for the following.

.SH NAME
firewalld \- Dynamic Firewall Manager

.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP \fBfirewalld\ \fR\fB[OPTIONS...]\fR\

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfirewalld\fR provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for network/firewall zones to define the trust level of network connections or interfaces. It has support for IPv4, IPv6 firewall settings and for ethernet bridges and has a separation of runtime and persistent configuration options. It also supports an interface for services or applications to add firewall rules directly.

.SH OPTIONS
These are the command line options of firewalld:
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints a short help text and exists.
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR[=\fI<level>\fR]
Set the debug level for firewalld to \fIlevel\fR. The debug output will be written to the firewalld log file \fI/var/log/firewalld\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-nofork\fR
Turn off daemon forking, firewalld runs in the foreground.

.SH CONCEPTS
firewalld has a D\-BUS interface for firewall configuration of services and applications. It also has a command line client for the user. Services or applications already using D\-BUS can request changes to the firewall with the D\-BUS interface directly. 
For more information on the firewalld D\-BUS interface, please have a look at the \fBfirewalld.dbus\fR(5) man page. 

firewalld provides support for zones, predefined services and ICMP types and has a separation of runtime and persistent configuration options.
Persistent configuration is loaded from XML files in /usr/lib/firewalld or /etc/firewalld (see \fBDIRECTORIES\fR).

If NetworkManager is not used, there are some limitations: firewalld will not get notified about network device renames. If firewalld gets started after the network is already up, the connections are not bound to a zone. 
Manually created interfaces are not bound to a zone. Please add them to a zone with \fIfirewall-cmd --zone=<zone> --add--interface=<interface>\fR.

.SS Zones
A network or firewall zone defines the trust level of the interface used for a connection. There are several pre\-defined zones provided by firewalld. Zone configuration options and generic information about zones are described in \fBfirewalld.zone\fR(5).

.SS Services
A service can be a list of local ports and destinations and additionally also a list of firewall helper modules automatically loaded if a service is enabled.
\fBfirewalld.service\fR(5). The use of predefined services makes it easier for the user to enable and disable access to a service.

.SS ICMP types
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is used to exchange information and also error messages in the Internet Protocol (IP). ICMP types can be used in firewalld to limit the exchange of these messages. For more information, please have a look at \fBfirewalld.icmptype\fR(5).

.SS Runtime configuration
The runtime configuration is not persistent and will only be restored for a reload. After restart or stop of the service or a system reboot, these options will be gone.

.SS Persistent configuration
The persistent configuration is stored in config files and will be restored with every machine boot or service reload or restart.

.SS Direct interface
The direct interface is mainly used by services or applications to add specific firewall rules. The rules are not persistent and need to get applied after receiving the \fIstart\fR, \fIrestart\fR or \fIreload\fR message from firewalld using D\-BUS.

.SH DIRECTORIES
firewalld supports two configuration directories:

.SS Default/Fallback configuration in \fI@PREFIX@/lib/firewalld\fR
This directory contains the default and fallback configuration provided by firewalld for \fIicmptypes\fR, \fIservices\fR and \fIzones\fR. The files provided with the firewalld package should not get changed and the changes are gone with an update of the firewalld package. Additional icmptypes, services and zones can be provided with packages or by creating files.

.SS System configuration settings in \fI@SYSCONFDIR@/firewalld\fR
The system or user configuration stored here is either created by the system administrator or by customization with the configuration interface of firewalld or by hand. The files will overload the default configuration files.

To manually change settings of pre-defined icmptypes, zones or services, copy the file from the default configuration directory to the corresponding directory in the system configuration directory and change it accordingly. 

It is not possible to overload immutable zones, because these may not get changed. If you are loading the defaults for a zone that has a default or fallback file, the file in \fI@SYSCONFDIR@/firewalld\fR will be renamed to \fI<file>.old\fR and the fallback will be used again.

For more information on icmptypes, please have a look at the \fIfirewalld.icmptype\fR(5) man page, for services at \fIfirewalld.service\fR(5) and for zones at \fIfirewalld.zone\fR(5).

.SH SIGNALS
Currently only SIGHUP is supported.

.SS SIGHUP
Reloads the complete firewall configuration. You can also use \fBfirewall\-cmd\ \-\-reload\fR. All runtime configuration settings will be restored. Persistent configuration will change according to options defined in the configuration files.

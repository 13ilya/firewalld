README for firewalld
====================

firewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with support for network or 
firewall zones to define the trust level of network connections or interfaces. 
It has support for IPv4, IPv6 firewall settings and for ethernet bridges and a 
separation of runtime and permanent configuration options. It also provides an 
interface for services or applications to add ip*tables and ebtables rules 
directly.
